# DevOps_Assignment
In this project I have completed the following stages:

Stage 1: Dockerization

Dockerize a simple Hello World Flask Application which responds with a message that is set up as an environment variable and deploy the docker image to AWS ECR.


Stage 2: CI/CD Pipeline

Develop a CI/CD pipeline(Github Actions/Jenkins or your own choice) which would lint the python code and push the updated image to ECR.


Stage 3: Deployment to ECS

Setup a workflow which would deploy the given ECR image to ECS on EC2 instance or Fargate.

and also
BONUS:

ECS could be configured for autoscaling and/or load-balancing.
